\section{Contribution}
\label{contribution}
As discussed in Section~\ref{related-work} and illustrated by Figure~\ref{fig-comparison} there is no tool which meets all requirements from Section~\ref{requirements}.
Our contribution is to implement a graph transformation tool having all those features we argued to be desirable.

As we plan to integrate the new tool into eMoflon::IBeX, we want to explore and exploit the potential of Democles, the underlying incremental, interpretative and extensible pattern matcher.
